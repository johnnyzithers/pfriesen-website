            "I began working on issues related to research ethics and oversight while working as a Research Assistant in the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University and continued to do so while a post doc at the Ethox Centre at the University of Oxford. Collaborative papers I have written on this topic include an evaluation of the Belmont Report in relation to the state of research ethics today, an examination of issues faced by the many novel regulatory bodies (e.g., conflict of interest committees, data safety monitoring boards) that have been developed in in the realm of research oversight, and a discussion of how research ethics and oversight ought to proceed in response to developing neurotechnologies. ",
            "Currently, I am leading a SSHRC-funded project on the topic of community involvement in research ethics oversight. This project aims to examine the demands, justifications, and strategies of various communities who seek to have a greater voice in governing the research that impacts them. I am also interested in how new forms of research, particularly those utilizing machine learning and especially in the domain of psychiatry, challenge our current systems of research ethics oversight. I am also part of an international working group seeking to examine justifications underlying participatory research and oversight. "
