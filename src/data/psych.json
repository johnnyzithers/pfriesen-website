            "I have long been interested in questions related to how knowledge is produced, and ought to be produced, in the field of psychiatry. I have written about the application of feminist standpoint theory to the field of psychiatry, asking whether lived experience can underlie the potential for a unique epistemic advantage within psychiatric research, as well as well as how a focus on measuring impact in participatory mental health research can obscure ethical justifications. I am currently exploring historical entanglements and contemporary contrasts between psychedelics and psychosis, as well as how participatory research in psychiatry should be shaped by the field's unique history, its reliance on subjectivity, and the nature of disagreement within the field.",
            "I have also been involved in several qualitative research projects in psychiatry. Two projects I am currently involved include an investigation of the experiences of participants and family members in the community-based mental health program, Parachute, and an exploration of the themes of identity and wellbeing among youth participating in the coordinated care early intervention program, OnTrackNY.",
            "I am also part of a network committed to building service user/survivor research capacities and welcome students with lived experience - in the classroom, as part of research projects, and as graduate students."
